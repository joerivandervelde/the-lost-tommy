### The story so far
Thick mud clung to his boots as he stumbled through the forest.
Moments ago, his platoon had been ambushed.
Now he was alone, behind enemy lines.
German voices echoed through the fog.
He made it to a clearing, breathing fast.
Shadows moved between the trunks and rifles flashed.
He fired back, his heart pounding with each shot.
He knew that the cavalry would arrive in one minute to save him.
Yet, every tick of his pocket watch felt like a lifetime.
Twenty seconds.
Thirty.
He fought not for glory, but for the hope of seeing home again.
For now, only survival mattered.

### Synopsis

You are a British solder (a 'Tommy') that must stay alive for one minute to win.
Your many enemies are ruthless and have even deployed barbed wire.
To stand a chance, you must rely on your trusty rifle, your swiftness, but most of all, your wits.
